% 1) What is the problem?

Stroke remains one of the top three global causes of death and disability \cite{feigin_global_2021}. Despite reductions in age-standardised rates of stroke, ageing populations are driving an increase in the absolute number of strokes \cite{feigin_global_2021}. Across Europe, in 2017, stroke was found to cost healthcare systems \texteuro 27 billion, or 1.7\% of health expenditure \cite{luengo-fernandez_economic_2020}. The burden is increasing; it has been estimated that the number of stroke survivors aged 45 and over in the UK will more than double between 2015 and 2035 \cite{king_future_2020}.

Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, can significantly reduce disability after ischaemic stroke, so long as it is given in the first few hours after stroke onset \cite{emberson_effect_2014}. Despite thrombolysis being of proven benefit in ischaemic stroke, use of thrombolysis varies significantly both between and within European countries \cite{aguiar_de_sousa_access_2019}. In England and Wales the national stroke audit reported that in 2021/22, 20 years on from the original European Medicines Agency licencing of alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke, thrombolysis rates for emergency stroke admissions varied from just 1\% to 28\% between hospitals \cite{sentinel_national_stroke_audit_programme_ssnap_2022}, with a median rate of 10.4\% and an inter-quartile range of 8\%-13\%, against a 2019 NHS England long term plan that 20\% of patients of emergency stroke admissions should be receiving thrombolysis \cite{nhs_long_term_plan_2019}.

% 2) What do we know about low and varying use of thrombolysis

Studies have shown that reasons for low and varying thrombolysis rates are multi-factorial. Reasons include late presentation \cite{aguiar_de_sousa_access_2019}, lack of expertise \cite{aguiar_de_sousa_access_2019} or lack of clear protocols or training \cite{carter-jones_stroke_2011}, delayed access to specialists \cite{kamal_delays_2017}, and poor triage by ambulance or emergency department staff \cite{carter-jones_stroke_2011}. For many factors, the establishment of primary stroke centres has been suggested to improve the emergency care of patients with stroke and reduce barriers to thrombolysis \cite{carter-jones_stroke_2011}, with a centralised model of primary stroke centres leading to increased likelihood of thrombolysis \cite{lahr_proportion_2012, morris_impact_2014, hunter_impact_2013}. 

In addition to organisational factors, clinicians can have varying attitudes to which patients are suitable candidates for thrombolysis. In a discrete choice experiment \cite{de_brun_factors_2018}, 138 clinicians considered hypothetical patient vignettes, and responded as to whether they would give the patients thrombolysis. The authors concluded that there was considerable heterogeneity among respondents in their thrombolysis decision-making. Areas of difference were around whether to give thrombolysis to mild strokes, to older patients beyond 3 hours from stroke onset, and where there was pre-existing disability.

Based on national audit data from three years of emergency stroke admissions, we have previously built models of the emergency stroke pathway using clinical pathway simulation to examine the potential scale of the effect of changing two aspects of the stroke pathway performance (in-hospital process speeds, and the proportion of patients with a determined stroke onset time), and used machine learning to examine the effect of replicating clinical decision-making from higher thrombolysing hospitals to those with lower willingness to thrombolyse \cite{allen_use_2022, allen_using_2022}. The machine learning model learned whether any particular patient would receive thrombolysis in any given emergency stroke centre. Using these models we found that it would be credible to target an increase in average thrombolysis in England and Wales, from 11\% to 18\%, but that each hospital should have its own target, reflecting differences in local populations. We found that the largest increase in thrombolysis use would come from replicating thrombolysis decision-making practice from higher to lower thrombolysing hospitals. 

In order to further understand variation around thrombolysis decision-making, we employed explainable machine learning to understand how patient characteristics and the hospital attended affect the odds of a patient receiving thrombolysis \cite{pearn_what_2023}. We found that the odds of receiving thrombolysis varied 13 fold between hospitals, with lower thombolysing hospitals especially more likely to avoid thrombolysis of non-ideal candidates such as patients with mild stroke, or those with pre-stroke disability.

% 3) What do we not know

Though our previous work illuminated how hospitals differ in their willingness to use thrombolysis, it did not address how these differences would likely affect outcomes, an important issue to clinicians when considering machine learning applied to use of thrombolysis \cite{allen_using_2022}. In the work described here we set out with the following aims:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To build an explainable machine learning model to predict patient outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, mRS) at discharge, and to understand how patient features affect predicted outcome. We planned to use an \emph{eXtreme Gradient Boosting model \cite{chen_xgboost_2016}} (XGBoost) to make predictions and then use an additional \emph{SHapley Additive exPlanations} \cite{lundberg_unified_2017} (SHAP) model to explain the contribution of each feature to the model prediction.

    \item Across a large cohort of patients, and across stroke teams, compare the expected use of thrombolysis and the expected outcome with and without thrombolysis.
    
\end{itemize}
